# Autonomous_Robotic_Forklift

Our forklift prioritizes safety above all else. Its design incorporates precise sizes, tolerances, and detailed working drawings for every component. We conducted comprehensive stress analysis for optimal performance. The final product stands out with its appealing shape, exceptional finishing, and seamless assembly.

Our project involved an embedded system with one Arduino Mega microcontroller as data buffer between the Jetson TX2 and two Tiva-C boards. Following AUTOSAR standards, our system incorporated the MCAL, HAL, and APP drivers. The MCAL layer included functionalities such as DIO, PORT, ADC, PWM, INTCTRL, UART, and TIMERS, while the HAL layer focused on Encoder, Motor, and LED functionalities. The App layer featured a PID controller, parsing capabilities, and serialization techniques for efficient data transmission.

We integrated ROS for Navigation and Localization, leveraging sensor data to determine the robot's position and orientation. This framework empowered our robot to navigate complex environments with confidence, ensuring optimal path planning, obstacle avoidance, and efficient movement.

We employed computer vision techniques using a pretrained YOLO CNN for object detection and recognition. Our computer vision module included QR code detection and scanning using the zbar ROS package, enabling the robot to identify goal destinations for precise movements.

The successful integration of ROS for Navigation and Localization in our project has advanced our understanding of robotics and equipped us with the skills necessary to contribute to the future of autonomous systems. I am proud of my team's accomplishments and look forward to further exploring innovation in robotics, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like ROS to redefine human-robot interaction.
